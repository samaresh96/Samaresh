we can recover exceptions but we can not recover errors

try,catch,finally,throw,throws

multi catch block(in updated java)

throws keyword used with the method (checked exception)
throw handles the exception
throw - throw the exception (it is used inside of the block , checked and unchecked both)


using throw and throws we can create our custom exceptions
